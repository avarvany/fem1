## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am just proud of the fact that despite toggling with HTML and CSS for over a year, I have never really built something like this.

Today, I managed to apply a few skills I've learned and the biggest moment was when I managed to use the media queries to adopt the responsiveness; that was huge. A very large portion of this credit goes to a very silent Internet warrior, the Interneting Is Hard admin who created a wonderful HTML and CSS tutorial but for some reason has gone quiet of late; huge thanks to him.

### Continued development

This is just my first project, so of course I want to keep doing more projects to get a better understanding of CSS especially, because it's quite complex, especially around the flexbox area. Of course, I also want to learn and apply more attributes to get more wonderful effects.

### Useful resources

- [As mentioned](https://www.internetingishard.com) - This helped me understand in depth the principles of CSS especially, not to forget semantic HTML.
- [The start of my journey](https://www.theodinproject.com) - This is an amazing website that offers novices the opportunity to learn to code, FOR FREE. Big up, guys.
