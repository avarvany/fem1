    <h1>My First Foray Into Code</h1>
    <p>Hi There! I say above that this is my first foray but <strong>it isn't</strong>; I have been trying now for the past one year to get into this and it has
        eluded me but I am not giving up, especially since I know I have the right and most equipment that I actually committed to buying for this project, so 
        I will keep doing this until I get the nuances right and become satisfactory at it, if not <em>world class</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>My biggest problems when doing this project</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Procrastination</li>
        <li>Laziness</li>
        <li>Don't know how to categorize this, but I just began to zone out when trying to learn (maybe you can call it stress)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What am I now going to do about this?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>As Kevin said, do 30 minutes every day if possible</li>
        <li>Know when my brain is tired, acknowledge, and take a pause</li>
        <li>Find some time <em><strong>every fuckin day</strong></em> to learn at least something new </li>
    </ol>
</body>
